The goal of our project is to point out which actors and actresses
or combination of both, are more frequently present in international
movies. In order to meet the aim of the project, we performed MarketBasket analysis on IMDB dataset,where actors and actresses have been
considered as ’items’ while movies have been identified as ’baskets’.
In the stream of the project we implemented differents taylored algorithm: the Apriori algorithms, the FP Growth algorithm, the SON
algorithm and the PCY algorithm. In order to perform our analysis
we implemented our algorithms on Spark, which is usefull for managing large datasets. The project has been written on Python 3 using
Google Collaboratory, for a better reproducibility of the results
